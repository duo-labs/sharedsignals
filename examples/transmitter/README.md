# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+

## Run with Docker Compose

From the `examples` directory:
```
docker-compose up transmitter
```
will build an image named `transmitter_1` and run it with development settings (hot-reloading).

## Run with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the `examples/transmitter` directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -f Dockerfile -t transmitter .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 80:80 -v "${PWD}":/usr/src/app transmitter
```

You can also run tests with docker, if you'd like:
```
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}":/usr/src/app cta-transmitter -m pytest
```

Note that this runs without hot-reloading.

## Run without docker
To run the server, please execute the following from the `examples/transmitter` directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

## Usage
To view the Swagger UI open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

## Development
To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
pip3 install tox
python3 -m tox
# run only certain tests:
python3 -m tox -- -k test_name_pattern
```



## Codegen

```
./run_codegen
```
Re-generates `swagger.yaml` and `models.py`. Run it from `examples/transmitter`
by running `./run_codegen.sh`
