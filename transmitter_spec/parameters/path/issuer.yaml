description: |
  Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host.
  This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations.
  This use of .well-known is for supporting multiple issuers per host;
  unlike its use in [RFC5785](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#RFC5785),
  it does not provide general information about the host.
