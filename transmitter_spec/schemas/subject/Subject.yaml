  [Spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secevent-subject-identifiers#section-3)

  As described in Section 1.2 of SET [RFC8417](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417),
  subjects related to security events may take a variety of forms,
  including but not limited to a JWT [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
  principal, an IP address, a URL, etc. Different types of subjects may need
  to be identified in different ways. (e.g., a host might be identified by an
  IP or MAC address, while a user might be identified by an email address)
  Furthermore, even in the case where the type of the subject is known,
  there may be multiple ways by which a given subject may be identified.
  For example, an account may be identified by an opaque identifier, an
  email address, a phone number, a JWT "iss" claim and "sub" claim,
  etc., depending on the nature and needs of the transmitter and
  receiver.  Even within the context of a given transmitter and
  receiver relationship, it may be appropriate to identify different
  accounts in different ways, for example if some accounts only have
  email addresses associated with them while others only have phone
  numbers.  Therefore it can be necessary to indicate within a SET the
  mechanism by which a subject is being identified.

  To address this problem, this specification defines Subject
  Identifiers - JSON [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
  objects containing information identifying a subject - and Identifier Formats -
  named sets of rules describing how to encode different kinds of subject
  identifying information (e.g., an email address, or an issuer and subject pair)
  as a Subject Identifier.
