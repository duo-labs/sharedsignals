  The Decentralized Identifier Format identifies a subject using a
  Decentralized Identifier (DID) URL as defined in [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
  Subject Identifiers in this format MUST contain a "url" member whose value is
  a DID URL for the DID Subject being identified.  The value of the
  "url" member MUST be a valid DID URL and MAY be a bare DID.  The
  "url" member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.  The
  Decentralized Identifier Format is identified by the name "did".
