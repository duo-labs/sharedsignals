  The Opaque Identifier Format describes a subject that is identified
  with a string with no semantics asserted beyond its usage as an
  identifier for the subject, such as a UUID or hash used as a
  surrogate identifier for a record in a database.  Subject Identifiers
  in this format MUST contain an "id" member whose value is a JSON
  string containing the opaque string identifier for the subject.  The
  "id" member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.  The Opaque
  Identifier Format is identified by the name "opaque".
