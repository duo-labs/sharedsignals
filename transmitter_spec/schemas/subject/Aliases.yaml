  The Aliases Identifier Format describes a subject that is identified
  with a list of different Subject Identifiers.  It is intended for use
  when a variety of identifiers have been shared with the party that
  will be interpreting the Subject Identifier, and it is unknown which
  of those identifiers they will recognize or support.  Subject
  Identifiers in this format MUST contain an "identifiers" member whose
  value is a JSON array containing one or more Subject Identifiers.
  Each Subject Identifier in the array MUST identify the same entity.
  The "identifiers" member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.
  It MAY contain multiple instances of the same Identifier Format
  (e.g., multiple Email Subject Identifiers), but SHOULD NOT contain
  exact duplicates.  This format is identified by the name "aliases".

  "alias" Subject Identifiers MUST NOT be nested; i.e., the
  "identifiers" member of an "alias" Subject Identifier MUST NOT
  contain a Subject Identifier in the "aliases" format.'
