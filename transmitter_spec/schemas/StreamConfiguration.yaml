  JSON Object describing and Event Stream's configuration
  [Spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#stream-config)"
properties:
  iss:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Read-Only.
      A URL using the https scheme with no query or fragment component that the Transmitter asserts as its Issuer
      Identifier. This MUST be identical to the iss Claim value in Security Event Tokens issued from this Transmitter.
    format: uri
    example: "https://tr.example.com"

    oneOf:
      - type: string
        format: uri
      - type: array
        items:
          type: string
          format: uri
    description: |-
      Read-Only.
      A string or an array of strings containing an audience claim as defined in
      [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#RFC7519) that identifies
      the Event Receiver(s) for the Event Stream. This property cannot be updated. If multiple Receivers are specified
      then the Transmitter SHOULD know that these Receivers are the same entity.
    example: [
      "http://receiver.example.com/web",
      "http://receiver.example.com/mobile"
    ]
  events_supported:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      format: uri
    description: |-
      Read-Only.
      An array of URIs identifying the set of events supported by the Transmitter for this Receiver.
      If omitted, Event Transmitters SHOULD make this set available to the Event Receiver via some other means
      (e.g. publishing it in online documentation).
    example: [
        "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked",
        "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/credential-compromise"
    ]
  events_requested:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      format: uri
    description: |-
      Read-Write.
      An array of URIs identifying the set of events that the Receiver requested.
      A Receiver SHOULD request only the events that it understands and it can act on.
      This is configurable by the Receiver.
    example: [
      "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/credential-compromise"
    ]
  events_delivered:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      format: uri
    description: |-
      Read-Only.
      An array of URIs which is the intersection of events_supported and events_requested.
      These events MAY be delivered over the Event Stream.
    example: [
      "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/credential-compromise"
    ]
  delivery:
    example:
      method: https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/delivery-method/poll
      endpoint_url: https://receiver.example.com/poll
    description: |-
      Read-Write.
      A JSON object containing a set of name/value pairs specifying configuration parameters for the SET delivery
      method. The actual delivery method is identified by the special key method with the value being a URI as defined
      in [Section 11.2.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#delivery-meta).

      - $ref: "../openapi.yaml#/components/schemas/PushDeliveryMethod"
      - $ref: "../openapi.yaml#/components/schemas/PollDeliveryMethod"
    discriminator:
      propertyName: method
  min_verification_interval:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      Read-Only.
      An integer indicating the minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass in between verification requests.
      If an Event Receiver submits verification requests more frequently than this, the Event Transmitter MAY respond
      with a 429 status code. An Event Transmitter SHOULD NOT respond with a 429 status code if an Event Receiver is not
      exceeding this frequency.
  format:
    type: string
    #    TODO: How to better link this to existing Subject Identifier Format options?
    description: |-
      Read-Write.
      The Subject Identifier Format that the Receiver wants for the events.
      If not set then the Transmitter might decide to use a type that discloses more information than necessary.
