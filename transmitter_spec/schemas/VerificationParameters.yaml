      OPTIONAL. An arbitrary string that the Event Transmitter
      MUST echo back to the Event Receiver in the verification
      eventâ€™s payload. Event Receivers MAY use the value of this
      parameter to correlate a verification event with a
      verification request. If the verification event is
      initiated by the transmitter then this parameter MUST not
      be set.
