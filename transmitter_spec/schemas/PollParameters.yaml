  maxEvents:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      An OPTIONAL integer value indicating the maximum number of unacknowledged SETs to be returned.
      The SET Transmitter SHOULD NOT send more SETs than the specified maximum.
      If more than the maximum number of SETs are available, the SET Transmitter determines which to return first;
      the oldest SETs available MAY be returned first, or another selection algorithm MAY be used,
      such as prioritizing SETs in some manner that makes sense for the use case.
      A value of 0 MAY be used by SET Recipients that would like to perform an acknowledge-only request.
      This enables the Recipient to use separate HTTP requests for acknowledgement and reception of SETs.
      If this parameter is omitted, no limit is placed on the number of SETs to be returned.
  returnImmediately:
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      An OPTIONAL JSON boolean value that indicates the SET Transmitter SHOULD return an immediate response even if no
      results are available (short polling). The default value is false, which indicates the request is to be treated
      as an HTTP long poll, per [Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6202#section-2) of
      [RFC6202](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8936.html#RFC6202).
      The timeout for the request is part of the configuration between the participants, which is out of scope of this specification.
  acks:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: List of event JTIs that the receiver is acknowledging. The Transmitter can stop keeping track of these.
