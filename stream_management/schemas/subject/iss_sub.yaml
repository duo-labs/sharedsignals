  The Issuer and Subject Identifier Format identifies a subject using a
  pair of "iss" and "sub" members, analagous to how subjects are
  identified using the "iss" and "sub" claims in OpenID Connect
  [OpenID.Core](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) ID Tokens.
  These members MUST follow the formats of the "iss" member and "sub" member
  defined by [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519), respectively.
  Both the "iss" member and the "sub" member are REQUIRED and MUST NOT
  be null or empty.  The Issuer and Subject Identifier Format is
  identified by the name "iss_sub".
