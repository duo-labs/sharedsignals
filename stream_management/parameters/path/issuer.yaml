description: Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host. This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations. This use of .well-known is for supporting multiple issuers per host; unlike its use in [RFC5785](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html#RFC5785), it does not provide general information about the host.
