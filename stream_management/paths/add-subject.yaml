      description: |-
        On a successful response, the Event Transmitter responds with an empty 200 OK response.
        The Event Transmitter MAY choose to silently ignore the request, for example if the subject has previously
        indicated to the transmitter that they do not want events to be transmitted to the Event Receiver.
        In this case, the transmitter MAY return an empty 200 OK response or an appropriate error code.
        See [Security Considerations](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#management-sec).
