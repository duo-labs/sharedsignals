  summary: Request to update the configuration of an event stream

    [Spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html#updating-a-streams-configuration)

    An Event Receiver updates the current configuration of a stream by making an HTTP POST request to the Configuration
    Endpoint. The POST body contains a JSON representation of the updated configuration. On receiving a valid request
    the Event Transmitter responds with a 200 OK response containing a JSON representation of the updated stream
    configuration in the body.

    The full set of editable properties must be present in the POST body, not only the ones that are specifically
    intended to be changed. Missing properties SHOULD be interpreted as requested to be deleted. Event Receivers should
    read the configuration first, modify the JSON representation, then make an update request.

    Properties that cannot be updated MAY be present, but they MUST match the expected value.

        The update request has been accepted, but not processed.
        Receiver MAY try the same request later in order to get processing result.

        If a Receiver makes a request to update the stream to enable it for a specific Subject, and the Transmitter is
        unable to decide whether or not to complete the request, then the Transmitter MUST respond with a 202 status
        code.
