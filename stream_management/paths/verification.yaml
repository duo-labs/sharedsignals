                OPTIONAL. An arbitrary string that the Event Transmitter
                MUST echo back to the Event Receiver in the verification
                eventâ€™s payload. Event Receivers MAY use the value of this
                parameter to correlate a verification event with a
                verification request. If the verification event is
                initiated by the transmitter then this parameter MUST not
                be set.

        Request for verification event was successfully received. A
        successful response from a POST to the Verification Endpoint does
        not indicate that the verification event was transmitted
        successfully, only that the Event Transmitter has transmitted the
        event or will do so at some point in the future.
